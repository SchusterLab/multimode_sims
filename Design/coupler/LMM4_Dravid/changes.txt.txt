Multimode 
1. Shorten 1000, should create stop band edge at 3.8 ghz. Let's see if exp mateches with hfss
   (whether 3.8 is within or not stop band)
2. Flux loop distance changed from 8 um to 6 um (as in last fab round of 2024)
3. Chip name in test structures
4. Dicing Lanes 
5. alignment marks NOT changed to crosses. need to know dimensions 
6. can only fit an open test structure in qubit
